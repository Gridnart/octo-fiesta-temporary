            <p style="font-size: 20px;padding: 10px;">
                Seth M.R. Jaipuria School, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow began its journey in 1992. It is recognized as one of
                the creme-de-la-creme names in education in India which provides education from play group to grade 12.
                We are guided by the Philosophy of Education promulgated by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. We believe in
                partnership with our parents to impart value based education to our children that would chisel them into
                good human beings, for education is not about getting 90% alone; it is about believing in and living the
                spirit of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam".<br>
                <span class="read-more-text">
                The school believes that all education is within so children are exposed to a wide range of
                co-curricular and extra-curricular activities to find their interests and perfection within. To develop
                the 21st century skills of analysis, innovation, creativity, problem solving, collaboration and

                About Navsrijan<br>
                In November 2010 Seth M.R. Jaipuria took the initiative to start a school for underprivileged children.
                We called it Navsrijan, a New Beginning, and enrolled 49 children in the first year. Today we have 340
                children. We take care of all their needs and impart free education (same as Jaipuria School), inclusive
                of uniform, books, IT education, fine arts and performing arts and sports. Besides regular classes, we
                teach them Sanskrit, Yoga, Music and hone their skills in sports. It’s a matter of pride for us that 36
                of the Navsrijan children joined mainstream school in the last 10 years and are now Jaipuria students,
                securing a whopping average of 80% and above, beating the mainstream students. They continue to study in
                Jaipuria School free of cost. Achievements:<br>

                <div class="letter-box">
                    <img src="../Images/anjali.jpg" class="letter-image" alt="">
                    
                    <h3>Mrs. Anjali Jaipuria</h3>
                    <p>
                        While the world pats itself on the back for becoming one global family, the truth is that we still have a long way to go to actually forge that bond. Globalization has surely helped us achieve tremendous progress, but somewhere in the process, the essence of belonging to each other has evaporated. We seem to be bound to each other not by a Universal Spirit but the very things that cause irreversible harm to it.<br>
                        While nations increase the strength of their armies, they hardly have the courage to hold an open and truthful discussion with each other, while we talk of being a global citizen, we find it difficult to accept and transform our own flaws. Terrorism has become a problem which seems to have no visible solution in the near future. In a race to outdo each other, the factor of Human Unity is completely lost and it is only a radical change in human consciousness that can alleviate our plight.
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            
                        Sri Aurobindo had said, “Nothing but a radical change of consciousness can save humanity from the terrible plight into which it is plunged.” These words, spoken in another era for another generation, hold as much value and relevance today as they did then.
                        This radical change of consciousness can happen only if young minds imbibe values of Human Unity through a gentle but conscious transformation of their being, by focusing as much on spiritual education as on academic excellence. It is only when the youth become conscious individuals, conscious not only of their outer progress but also conscious of their inner progress, that they will take steps to promote harmony, peace and brotherhood in the community at large.<br>

                        It is only a conscious transformation of the emotional and mental nature of young adults which will make them more aware of their responsibility, responsibility not only towards their own advancement but a mindful responsibility towards Mother Nature, towards humanity at large. Such inspired minds will take it upon themselves to foster the spirit of Human Unity among all, or what is known as Vasudhaiva Kutumbakum, the whole world is one family.
                        Educational institutions need to go beyond conventional teaching and create curriculums which foster, through the component of spiritual education, the spirit of Human Unity in their students. And this must be done gradually, through a well curated educational programme, from Playgroup to Grade 12. This is where exercises like the Model United Nations also come into play. They not only educate students on the delicate socio- political balance of nations, but also help them understand the bigger picture, the universal spirit of equality, fraternity and brotherhood.<br>
                        I invite students of different schools to participate in Jaipuria MUN heartily. Together may you all raise the consciousness of the Universe with your good will!

                    <p>
                        Dear Aspirants,<br>
                        Human beings must have an aim, a lofty aim, if the human race has to evolve. On the quality of the aim, the resolute will and perseverance to realise the aim, depends our progress and the quality of our life.<br>
                        Those who conceived ‘The United Nations’ at the end of World War II had a high, wide and generous aim of raising the consciousness of the world towards Human Rights, Peace and Security. They could perceive the consequential progress and development of nations. Despite all the threats at the boundaries of nations, a realisation to refrain from war rules the globe in the present time. Thanks to the United Nations!<br>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                        JMUN and The United Nations are cognate in the loftiness of their aim. Whatever be our ideal, it cannot be realised unless you and us imagine, organise, internalise, create and collaborate to arrive at perfect solutions in our committees. Your excellence and accomplishments will be our honour for they are essential for us to reach our aim. Together we grow! Replete with opportunities to take initiatives and think critically, deliberate over global problems to arrive at inclusive collaborative solutions, JMUN invites insightful thinking minds and impactful speakers who can accept and abnegate assumptions with equanimity.<br>
                        We invite you to find your sweet spot as you play your role in the joyfully educative, stimulating, diplomatic simulation.
                        The JMUN experience awaits you.<br>
                        Best wishes.

                    <h3>Dr. Preeti Singh</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dear Sir/ Madam,
                        Nothing like living through a pandemic to make us understand why Jane Austen’s readers swooned when Mr. Darcy said, “I trust your family is in good health.” Likewise, I hope this reaches you in wholesomeness.
                        While the past year has made us familiarize with the truth that life is a very uncertain deal, and it is ending one day at a time, it has also awoken us to the fact that there is a lot to be thankful for- everyday.<br>
                        The mind is rendered conscious of the unfortunate battles that the world faces today. The external conflicts have aligned themselves with those internally and every man fights a foe- from six feet apart, of course.
                        We see that the troubles are not modernist, but the oblivion towards the issues has been catered to in the modern world. Today, peace is sensitized, and peace breakers are penalized; leaders are cooperated with, and dictators are sidelined; justice is supreme, and the lack of it is intolerable; and although we still have a long way to go, the world is more demanding now than ever, and rightly so.
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                        Today, we need questions, we need answers, we need rebuttals, we need resolutions. The need of the hour are forums- on all levels, that let us channel our questions, answers, rebuttals, and resolutions. Today, we need to go the extra mile in the dream of a better tomorrow.<br>
                        At the Jaipuria Model United Nations, we acknowledge the need to deliberate our agenda, defend our purpose and deliver the best of our knowledge. As we look back upon the glory of our last seven editions, we feel the tremors will be shakier this time.<br>
                        We sincerely welcome you to the eighth, and the first virtual edition of the Jaipuria Model United Nations. From striving for excellence as means to attain perfection to redefining perfection and striving for excellence, in its quest alone, we have outpaced our potential.
                        Mark your calendars for the 23rd-25th July 2021. The season to deliberate, defend and deliver is here.
                        We look forward to having fruitful discussions in the global interest and hope you will take back good learning from here.<br>
                        Regards.
